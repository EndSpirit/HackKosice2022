# HackKosice2022

Our truly horrendous attempt at the visma tech challenge that came about due to our inexperience.
this Repo includes the clusterfuck attempt at joining a django backend and a copypasta of a front end(Login folder), the original frontend b4 joining and a script that was supposed to be used for creating QR codes on hovering over an element.

Opening the Login folder in VScode opening a new terminal adn doing:

1. cd login
2. python manage.py runserver
